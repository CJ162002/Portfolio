                        <p>Powerline Communication (PLC) System is a project that transmits data signals over existing power lines using high-frequency signals. We used an STM32 microcontroller to generate PWM signals, which were sent through a line tuner for impedance matching. This setup ensured safe and efficient signal injection into the power line.</p>
                        <p>At the receiving end, a wave trap acted as a low-pass filter, blocking high-frequency signals from entering sensitive switchyard components. Another coupling capacitor extracted the communication signal from the power line. This project deepened my knowledge of embedded systems, signal filtering, and communication protocols. It demonstrated how data can be transmitted over power infrastructure using efficient hardware design.</p><br>

                        <p>The Remote Control Robot Car project was built using NodeMCU and the L298N motor driver module. The NodeMCU was programmed to control motor movement by sending signals to the L298N through GPIO pins. Pins D0 to D3 were connected to the input terminals of the motor driver, while D5 and D6 controlled motor speed via the enable pins. This allowed precise remote control of the robot's movement using Wi-Fi.</p>
                        <p>The L298N motor driver was connected to two DC motors, referred to as Motor A and Motor B. Power was supplied through a battery connected to both the motor driver and NodeMCU. This setup enabled real-time wireless control of the robot car using a mobile application. Through this project, I gained practical experience in embedded programming, motor driver interfacing, and IoT-based control systems.</p><br>
